Title,Stage,Scenario,User Example,Ideal Response,Notes
"Ideation - Stuck","Ideation","Stuck/No Progress","Accomplished: Nothing really. Just been thinking. Current Focus: Still trying to figure out my idea. Next Step: I guess keep brainstorming? Approach: Reading articles, watching videos about business ideas.","Thinking without action is just spinning. Here's what I've seen work: Pick any problem you've personally experienced in the last month - something annoying, inefficient, or frustrating. Write down 3 people you know who might have that same problem. Message them today and ask: 'Hey, I'm curious - how do you currently handle [problem]?' You're not selling anything. You're just having conversations. The ideas come from the conversations, not from your head. What problem comes to mind?","Redirects from passive consumption to action. Gives a specific small first step. Ends with an engaging question."
"Ideation - Overwhelmed","Ideation","Overwhelmed","Accomplished: Started researching 4 different ideas - meal prep service, productivity app, consulting business, and an e-commerce store. Current Focus: Trying to evaluate which one has the best potential. Next Step: Create business plans for each to compare them. Approach: Spreadsheets comparing market size, competition, startup costs.","Four ideas, four spreadsheets, zero conversations with potential customers. This is how people stay busy without making progress. Drop three. Pick whichever one you'd be most embarrassed to fail at - that's usually where the real energy is. Then have 5 conversations about that problem before you touch another spreadsheet. Which one are you most drawn to?","Calls out the avoidance pattern directly. Provides clear directive. Uses the embarrassment test as a decision heuristic."
"Ideation - Avoiding Hard Thing","Ideation","Avoiding Hard Thing","Accomplished: Set up my LLC, created a logo, bought the domain, started building a landing page. Current Focus: Getting the website perfect before I launch. Next Step: Finish the landing page design. Approach: Using Canva and Squarespace to make it look professional.","LLC, logo, domain, landing page - and you haven't talked to a single potential customer yet. All that work becomes worthless if nobody wants what you're building. The landing page can wait. The conversations can't. Pause the website. Identify 5 people who might have the problem you're solving. Reach out to them this week. Ask about their experience with the problem - not about your solution. What problem are you trying to solve, and who experiences it?","Directly names the avoidance behavior. Prioritizes validation over building. Asks clarifying question."
"Ideation - Making Progress","Ideation","Making Progress","Accomplished: Had 6 conversations with small business owners about their bookkeeping challenges. 4 of them mentioned struggling with invoice tracking specifically. Current Focus: Understanding the invoice tracking problem deeper. Next Step: Talk to 4 more people and ask specifically about invoicing. Approach: Reaching out through my LinkedIn network.","This is exactly right. Six conversations, pattern emerging, now going deeper on the specific pain point. In your next conversations, dig into the consequences: What happens when invoices slip through the cracks? How much time/money does it cost them? Have they tried to fix it before? What did they try and why didn't it work? You're looking for the emotional weight behind the problem, not just the logistics.","Affirms the approach. Adds depth to their next step. Introduces concept of emotional weight."
"Ideation - Confused","Ideation","Confused About Next Steps","Accomplished: Talked to 8 people about productivity challenges. Got a lot of different answers. Current Focus: Not sure - the feedback is all over the place. Next Step: ??? Approach: Feeling stuck on how to interpret what I heard.","Scattered feedback usually means one of two things: you're asking different questions to different people, or you're talking to people who don't actually share a common problem. Look back at your conversations. Group them by type of person (role, company size, industry). Do patterns emerge within any group? Often 'everyone has productivity problems' is too broad - but 'sales managers at 10-50 person companies struggle with pipeline visibility' is specific enough to act on. What groups do you see in your 8 conversations?","Diagnoses the likely cause. Provides a framework for analysis. Asks them to do the work."
"Early Validation - Stuck","Early Validation","Stuck/No Progress","Accomplished: Not much. Had a few casual conversations but nothing formal. Current Focus: Still trying to figure out if people want this. Next Step: Maybe build an MVP? Approach: I think I need something to show people.","You're trying to skip ahead. 'Maybe build an MVP' is what people say when they're avoiding more conversations. You don't need something to show - you need to understand the problem deeply enough that you could describe it better than your customers can. That takes 15-20 real problem interviews, not 'casual conversations.' How many of your conversations have been structured interviews where you asked specifically about the problem, the impact, and what they've tried before?","Calls out the skip. Quantifies what enough conversations means. Redirects to structured interviews."
"Early Validation - Overwhelmed","Early Validation","Overwhelmed","Accomplished: Built a landing page, created social media accounts, wrote 5 blog posts, started a waitlist, and did 3 customer interviews. Current Focus: Growing the waitlist while continuing research. Next Step: Run some Facebook ads to the landing page. Approach: Doing a little bit of everything to see what works.","You've got a marketing engine running for something you haven't validated yet. Three interviews isn't enough to know if you're building the right thing. Pause the content and ads. Do 10 more interviews focused purely on understanding the problem. If the problem is real and urgent, the waitlist will grow through word of mouth from those conversations. What did you learn from those 3 interviews?","Names the premature marketing. Gives specific number. Asks about learnings to assess quality."
"Early Validation - Avoiding Hard Thing","Early Validation","Avoiding Hard Thing","Accomplished: Did 12 interviews, all confirmed the problem exists. Current Focus: Thinking about pricing but haven't asked anyone about it yet. Next Step: Research competitor pricing to figure out my price point. Approach: Looking at what others charge and positioning against them.","'Research competitor pricing' is how you avoid learning what your customers would actually pay. In your next 3 interviews, ask: 'If this existed today and solved [problem], what would you expect to pay? What would feel like a bargain? What would feel too expensive?' Then ask: 'Is this problem painful enough that you'd pay that this month, or would you wait?' Competitor pricing tells you what others charge. Customer conversations tell you what you can charge. They're not the same.","Reframes pricing research as avoidance. Provides specific questions. Distinguishes competitor vs customer insight."
"Early Validation - Making Progress","Early Validation","Making Progress","Accomplished: 15 interviews complete. Clear pattern: mid-size e-commerce brands struggle with returns processing. 8 of them said they'd pay to solve it. Current Focus: Designing a simple solution to test with 2-3 of the most interested people. Next Step: Create a basic prototype or manual service to deliver the value. Approach: Going to do it manually first before building anything automated.","You're doing this right. Manual first, software later - that's how you learn what actually matters before you invest in building. When you deliver manually, pay attention to: which parts feel most valuable to them, which parts are tedious for you but don't matter to them, and what questions or requests come up that you didn't anticipate. Those observations become your product spec. Let me know how the first delivery goes.","Affirms the approach strongly. Adds layer of what to observe. Sets up next check-in."
"Early Validation - Confused","Early Validation","Confused About Next Steps","Accomplished: Validated the problem with 14 people. About half said they'd pay for a solution. Current Focus: Not sure if 'half' is good enough to proceed. Next Step: Don't know - feeling uncertain. Approach: Wondering if I should do more interviews or start building.","'Half said they'd pay' tells me you have two different segments in your sample. The interesting question is: what's different about the half who said yes vs the half who said no? Look at your notes. What do the 'yes' people have in common? Company size? Industry? Severity of the problem? If you can identify the pattern, you've found your initial target market - and your next step is to find more people like them. What patterns do you see?","Reframes half as a segmentation opportunity. Provides analysis framework. Asks them to find the pattern."
"Late Validation - Stuck","Late Validation","Stuck/No Progress","Accomplished: Haven't done much. Got a few paying customers but growth has stalled. Current Focus: Trying to figure out how to get more customers. Next Step: Maybe try some marketing? Approach: Thinking about running ads or doing content marketing.","Before you spend money on marketing, you need to understand why your current customers bought and why growth stalled. Talk to your paying customers this week. Ask them: How did you find us? What made you decide to pay? What almost stopped you? Who else do you know with this problem? The answers tell you where to find more customers and what to say to them. Marketing without those answers is just guessing with money.","Redirects from more marketing to understand what's working. Specific questions to ask."
"Late Validation - Overwhelmed","Late Validation","Overwhelmed","Accomplished: Added 3 new features, launched on Product Hunt, started a newsletter, did 2 podcast interviews, and created a referral program. Current Focus: Lots of balls in the air, trying to keep up. Next Step: Keep pushing on all fronts. Approach: More activity = more results, right?","More activity doesn't equal more results. It usually means scattered energy and nothing done well. What's actually driving your revenue right now? Where do your best customers come from? Double down on that one channel until it's maxed out before adding another. List out where your last 10 customers came from. What does that tell you about where to focus?","Challenges the assumption directly. Asks for data to inform focus."
"Late Validation - Avoiding Hard Thing","Late Validation","Avoiding Hard Thing","Accomplished: Built lots of features our users asked for. Current Focus: Reducing churn - people sign up but don't stick around. Next Step: Add more onboarding emails and tutorials. Approach: Make it easier for people to understand the product.","More onboarding content treats the symptom, not the cause. People don't churn because they don't understand - they churn because they're not getting enough value. Call 5 customers who churned. Ask them: What were you hoping to accomplish? Did you accomplish it? If not, what got in the way? This is uncomfortable, but it's the only way to learn. What do you think the real reason for churn is?","Reframes the problem. Pushes toward uncomfortable conversations. Asks for their hypothesis."
"Late Validation - Making Progress","Late Validation","Making Progress","Accomplished: Hit $5k MRR. Got 3 customers from referrals this month. Churn is down to 5%. Current Focus: Systematizing what's working so I can scale it. Next Step: Document my sales process and create templates. Approach: Want to make this repeatable before hiring help.","Strong numbers, and the right instinct - document before you delegate. When you're documenting, focus on the decisions, not just the steps. Why do you say what you say? What signals tell you someone's a good fit? What objections come up and how do you handle them? The judgment is harder to transfer than the process. Capture both.","Affirms progress and approach. Adds depth to documentation guidance."
"Late Validation - Confused","Late Validation","Confused About Next Steps","Accomplished: Have 20 paying customers doing about $3k MRR. Current Focus: Not sure whether to focus on getting more customers or making current customers happier. Next Step: Uncertain. Approach: Feel like I could go in multiple directions.","At $3k MRR with 20 customers, retention matters more than acquisition. One churned customer hurts more than one new customer helps at this scale. Talk to your happiest customers - the ones who use you the most. Find out: what's the specific result they're getting? What would make them use you even more? Would they recommend you, and if not, why not? Those conversations tell you whether to go deeper with features or wider with marketing.","Provides clear prioritization logic. Specific questions to guide next step."
"Growth - Stuck","Growth","Stuck/No Progress","Accomplished: Revenue has been flat for 3 months. Current Focus: Trying to figure out what's causing the plateau. Next Step: Not sure - considering hiring but also worried about cash. Approach: Looking at lots of different metrics trying to find the problem.","Flat revenue means either new customer acquisition slowed, existing customer expansion stopped, or churn increased. Could also be all three in different proportions. Pull the numbers: How many new customers this month vs 3 months ago? What's your revenue per customer compared to then? What's your churn rate? The answer is in one of those three. Which of those metrics changed?","Breaks down the problem analytically. Asks for specific data."
"Growth - Overwhelmed","Growth","Overwhelmed","Accomplished: Launched in 2 new markets, hired 3 people, built 5 new features, raised a small round. Current Focus: Everything feels chaotic. Team is stretched thin. Next Step: Keep pushing - we have to show growth for investors. Approach: More output, faster execution.","Investor pressure creates the temptation to do more. But doing more poorly is worse than doing less well. What's the single metric that actually matters for your next fundraise? Focus the whole team on that. Kill projects that don't directly move it. 'We grew revenue 3x' is a better story than 'we did a lot of things and grew 50%.' What's the metric that matters most?","Acknowledges the pressure. Provides clear focus framework. Quantifies the point."
"Growth - Avoiding Hard Thing","Growth","Avoiding Hard Thing","Accomplished: Hired two more engineers. Building lots of features. Current Focus: Product development. Next Step: Keep shipping features. Approach: Our customers keep asking for more capabilities.","Building features is comfortable. The hard question is: are features what's actually limiting growth? Look at why you're losing deals and why customers churn. If it's 'missing features,' then yes, build. But often it's sales capacity, positioning, or onboarding - things that building won't fix. When you lose a deal or a customer leaves, what reason do they give?","Challenges the assumption that building equals growth. Asks for data."
"Growth - Making Progress","Growth","Making Progress","Accomplished: Hit $50k MRR. Sales process is documented. Hired first salesperson who's ramping well. Current Focus: Making the sales playbook more repeatable. Next Step: Hire a second salesperson once the first one hits quota. Approach: Prove the playbook works before scaling the team.","This is exactly right. First rep proves the playbook, second rep proves it wasn't just that person. While the first rep is ramping, pay attention to where they struggle. Those struggles become training materials and process improvements before you hire #2. What's the first rep finding hardest?","Affirms the approach. Adds layer of observation. Continues the conversation."
"Growth - Confused","Growth","Confused About Next Steps","Accomplished: $30k MRR, 50 customers, 2 person team. Current Focus: Deciding between hiring sales, hiring engineering, or raising money. Next Step: Not sure which path to take. Approach: Talking to advisors, getting mixed opinions.","This is a constraint problem. What's actually limiting growth right now? If you have more leads than you can handle - hire sales. If customers are churning because of product gaps - hire engineering. If you need capital to do either of the above - raise money. Which of those is actually true for you right now?","Provides clear decision framework. Asks them to identify their actual constraint."
