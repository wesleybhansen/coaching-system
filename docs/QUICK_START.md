# Quick Start Guide -- The Launchpad Incubator Coaching

Welcome to your personal coaching experience. You now have a coach in your corner -- Wes -- who will check in with you regularly, track your progress, and give you direct, actionable feedback to move your business forward. All through email, on your schedule, in about five minutes a week.

No apps. No portals. No scheduling calls. Just your inbox.

## How It Works

It is simple: Wes sends you short check-in emails. You reply with what you are working on. He sends back focused coaching advice tailored to your stage, your business, and your specific challenges. Every exchange builds on the last, so the coaching gets sharper over time.

The whole experience lives in your email. You do not need to learn anything new, download anything, or log in anywhere. Reply to an email, and that is your coaching session.

## Step 1: Your Welcome Email

You will receive a welcome email from Wes at the start of the program. Reply to it with three things:

1. **Your stage** -- pick the one that fits best:
   - *Ideation* -- still figuring out the idea
   - *Early Validation* -- testing if people want this
   - *Late Validation* -- have some traction, refining the model
   - *Growth* -- growing and scaling
2. **Your business idea** -- a couple of sentences is plenty. If you do not have one yet, just say "still figuring it out." That is a perfectly valid starting point.
3. **Your biggest challenge right now** -- what is the one thing keeping you stuck or uncertain?

That reply kicks everything off. The more specific you are, the better the coaching from day one.

## Step 2: Your Check-Ins Begin

Once you are set up, you will receive check-in emails twice a week (typically **Tuesdays and Fridays**). Each one asks you four quick things:

- What you accomplished since last time
- What you are focused on now
- Your most important next step
- How you are approaching it

A few sentences for each is all it takes. These check-ins create the rhythm that keeps you moving forward -- even when things get busy. They are designed to take about five minutes. Not a homework assignment. Just a quick moment of reflection and accountability.

## Step 3: Get Coaching Feedback

Within about a day of your reply, you will get a coaching response back from Wes. This is not generic advice. Your coach remembers your business idea, your stage, your history, and the specific challenges you have shared. Every response is grounded in Wes's complete library of books and lectures -- the same material that drives the Launchpad curriculum. Expect responses that are direct, focused, and built around one or two things you can act on immediately.

When a specific lecture or book chapter is relevant to what you are working on, Wes will point you to it by name -- whether that is a validation framework from *The Launch System*, a marketing insight from *Ideas That Spread*, a hidden opportunity from *The Opportunity Engine*, or a specific lecture from the course. You always know exactly where to go for more depth.

The pattern is simple: you share what is happening, you get targeted feedback, you take action, and we do it again. That cycle is what drives real progress.

## Quick Tips for Getting the Most Out of Coaching

- **Reply promptly, even if briefly.** A short update is far better than no update. Do not wait until you have something impressive to share.
- **Be specific.** "I talked to three potential customers this week and none seemed interested in paying" is much more useful than "I made some progress."
- **Act on suggestions before the next check-in.** The coaching works best when you treat each response as a challenge to complete before the next one arrives.
- **Need a break?** Reply "pause" to any email and check-ins will stop. Reply "resume" when you are ready to pick back up. No pressure, no questions asked. Your progress is saved.
- **Follow-up questions welcome.** If something is unclear or you want to go deeper, just reply in the same email thread. You can go back and forth up to 4 times per check-in cycle.
- **Share wins too.** Coaching is not just for when things go wrong. Sharing wins helps Wes calibrate what is working and build on it.

## The Four Stages

Your coaching is tailored to where you are right now:

- **Ideation** -- Finding problems worth solving and identifying opportunities through real conversations with real people. Coaching pushes you to get out of your head and talk to people.
- **Early Validation** -- Testing whether people will actually pay for your solution before you build it. Coaching focuses on structured interviews and getting to your first paying customer.
- **Late Validation** -- Refining what is working, understanding why customers stay or leave, and building repeatable processes. Coaching challenges you to go deep, not wide.
- **Growth** -- Scaling what works, making smart hiring decisions, and building systems. Coaching helps you think like a CEO, not just a busy founder.

As you progress, your coaching evolves with you. Stage transitions happen naturally -- Wes will recognize when you are ready to level up, and the advice, resources, and expectations all adapt accordingly.
