# The Launchpad Incubator Coaching System
## Your Personal Entrepreneurship Coach, Right in Your Inbox

---

Welcome to something different.

Most entrepreneurship programs give you a stack of lectures, a Slack group, and a "good luck." The Launchpad Incubator takes a different approach. You now have access to personalized, one-on-one coaching from Wes -- delivered straight to your email, on a schedule that works for your life.

No new apps to download. No portals to remember. No group threads to keep up with. Just open your inbox, reply to Wes, and get focused coaching feedback tailored to *your* business, *your* stage, and *your* specific challenges.

Think of it as having a sharp, experienced entrepreneurship coach in your pocket -- one who remembers everything you've told him, knows exactly where you are in your journey, and is relentlessly focused on helping you take the *right* next step.

This guide walks you through everything the coaching system can do for you and how to get the absolute most out of it.

## How It Works (The Big Picture)

The whole experience happens through email. Here is the rhythm:

**1. You receive a check-in email from Wes** -- a short, focused prompt asking what you've been working on, what you're focused on now, and where you're headed next.

**2. You reply** -- takes about five minutes. Share what you've accomplished, what you're wrestling with, and what you're planning to do next.

**3. You get personalized coaching feedback** -- Wes reads your update and sends back a targeted response. Not a generic pep talk. Specific, actionable guidance based on *your* situation, *your* stage, and *your* history in the program.

That is the whole loop. Check-in, reply, coaching. Rinse and repeat.

Everything stays threaded in your email inbox like a natural conversation. You can scroll back and see your entire coaching history in one place. No logging into dashboards, no hunting for old messages. It is all right there.

**Why email?** Because you already use it. Every day. There is no friction, no learning curve, and no extra tool competing for your attention. You are building a business -- the last thing you need is another app.

## Getting Started (Your Onboarding)

When you first join the program, here is what to expect:

### Step 1: Your Welcome Email

You will receive a welcome email from Wes at `coachwes@thelaunchpadincubator.com`. It is short, warm, and to the point. It explains how coaching works and asks you for three things:

- **Where you are right now** -- Are you still figuring out an idea (Ideation)? Testing whether people want what you are building (Early Validation)? Refining a model that already has some traction (Late Validation)? Or growing and scaling something that is working (Growth)?
- **Your biggest challenge or question right now** -- What is keeping you up at night? What feels like the biggest obstacle?
- **Your current business idea** -- A couple of sentences is perfect. If you do not have an idea yet, that is completely fine -- say so, and that is exactly where coaching will start.

### Step 2: Your Follow-Up

After you reply, Wes will send a quick follow-up asking about your current challenge in a bit more detail. This helps calibrate your coaching from day one.

### Step 3: You Are Activated

Once Wes has your context, your regular check-ins begin. You will start hearing from Wes on your scheduled days, and the coaching conversation is officially rolling.

**The whole onboarding takes about 10 minutes of your time**, spread across two short email exchanges. After that, you are fully set up and coaching is underway.

---

## Your Personalized Check-Ins

This is the heart of the coaching experience.

### What to Expect

On your scheduled check-in days, you will receive an email from Wes with a few focused questions. Sometimes it is a structured check-in asking about what you accomplished, your current focus, your next step, and your approach. Other times, especially as your coaching relationship develops, it will be a personalized question that picks up right where your last conversation left off.

**Check-ins are designed to take about five minutes to answer.** You do not need to write an essay. A sentence or two for each question is perfect. The goal is consistent, lightweight momentum -- not a homework assignment.

### Your Schedule

By default, check-ins come on **Tuesdays and Fridays**. This creates a natural rhythm -- one at the start of the week to set your focus, one at the end to reflect on what happened. This cadence can be adjusted. You can receive up to three check-ins per week on whatever days work best for you. Just let Wes know what you prefer.

Some members prefer Monday/Wednesday/Friday for tighter accountability. Others prefer just once a week during particularly busy seasons. It is completely flexible.

### The Conversation Flow

Here is what a typical cycle looks like:

1. **Wes sends a check-in** on your scheduled day
2. **You reply** with your update
3. **Wes sends back coaching feedback** -- usually within a day
4. **You can reply again** if you have follow-up questions or want to go deeper

Each check-in cycle allows for back-and-forth. You can exchange up to **4 replies per cycle** before a fresh check-in starts the next round. This is intentional -- it keeps conversations focused and forward-moving rather than spiraling into endless threads. When your next scheduled check-in arrives, a new cycle begins with a fresh prompt.

### Why This Works

Most people fail at building a business not because they lack information, but because they lack **accountability and focused feedback at the right time**. These check-ins create a rhythm of action, reflection, and adjustment that compounds over weeks and months.

You will be surprised how much ground you cover when someone is consistently asking you the right questions.

## Personalized Coaching That Gets Smarter Over Time

This is not a one-size-fits-all experience. Here is what makes your coaching genuinely personal:

### Tailored to Your Stage

Whether you are in Ideation, Early Validation, Late Validation, or Growth, the coaching advice you receive is calibrated to where you actually are. An Ideation-stage founder gets coached very differently from someone scaling a team. The questions are different, the frameworks are different, and the expectations are different.

A founder in Ideation will be pushed to talk to people, not sit behind a laptop building things. A founder in Late Validation will be coached on retention and unit economics, not customer discovery. The advice always matches where you are, not where the curriculum happens to be.

### Your Coach Remembers Everything

Every conversation you have with Wes builds on the ones before it. Your business idea, your past challenges, key decisions you have made, milestones you have hit, and pivots you have taken -- it is all part of your coaching context. You will never have to re-explain your situation from scratch.

When you mention "that customer call from last week," Wes knows what you are talking about. When you say you are struggling with pricing, Wes already knows what you tried before and what happened. This persistent memory across conversations means coaching gets sharper with every exchange.

Think about how frustrating it is to explain your entire business context from scratch every time you talk to an advisor. That never happens here. The coaching picks up exactly where you left off.

### Program Resources, Referenced by Name

When a specific lecture, book chapter, or framework is relevant to what you are working on, Wes will point you to it directly. Not a generic "go review the materials" -- more like "Lecture 7 walks through exactly this" or "Chapter 3 of the Launch System has a good framework here." You always know exactly where to look for more depth on a topic.

This means the program's entire knowledge base -- the lectures, the books, the frameworks -- is effectively at your fingertips through every coaching exchange. You do not have to hunt for the right resource. It finds you at the right moment.

### Stage Progression is Celebrated

When you hit a milestone -- your first customer conversation, your first sale, your first hire -- Wes notices. These moments are acknowledged, and your coaching naturally evolves to match your new stage. You do not get stuck receiving advice meant for someone three steps behind you.

Stage transitions are a big deal. When you move from Ideation to Early Validation, it means you have found a problem worth solving. When you move from Early Validation to Late Validation, it means someone is paying you. These are real accomplishments, and the coaching recognizes them. From that point forward, everything adapts -- the questions, the frameworks, the resources, and the expectations.

### Coaching That Learns and Improves

Here is something most people do not realize: the coaching gets better the more you use it. When Wes makes a correction or refinement to a coaching response, that feedback is remembered and applied going forward. The system literally learns what works best for you and for members in similar situations. The longer you are in the program, the sharper and more dialed-in your coaching becomes.

This is not a static product. It is a living system that evolves with you and gets better at its job over time.

## The Four Stages of Your Entrepreneurship Journey

Your coaching is built around four stages. Understanding which stage you are in helps you focus on the *right* work at the *right* time -- and ignore everything else.

### Ideation -- Finding Your Opportunity

**Where you are:** You are exploring. You might have a vague idea, several competing ideas, or no idea at all. That is perfectly fine.

**What coaching focuses on:**
- Getting you out of your head and into real conversations with real people
- Finding problems worth solving -- not by brainstorming alone, but by listening to the people who experience them
- Picking ONE idea to explore rather than juggling many
- Overcoming the fear of talking to strangers about their problems
- Building the habit of customer discovery

**The big insight at this stage:** Ideas do not come from thinking harder. They come from conversations with people who have problems. Your job right now is to talk to people, not to plan.

**What you can expect from Wes:** Direct, no-nonsense nudges to stop researching and start talking. If you are spinning your wheels on spreadsheets and market analysis, expect to be called out -- kindly, but clearly. If you have been "thinking about it" for three weeks without a single conversation, Wes will notice, and you will hear about it.

### Early Validation -- Testing Your Hypothesis

**Where you are:** You have an idea. Now you need to find out if people actually want it -- and if they will pay for it.

**What coaching focuses on:**
- Conducting structured customer interviews (not just casual conversations)
- Testing willingness to pay before you build anything
- Creating a minimum viable offer -- doing things manually before automating
- Getting to your first paying customer
- Avoiding the trap of building too early

**The big insight at this stage:** Do not build it until someone will pay for it. The hardest and most important conversations are about money. If you are avoiding the pricing conversation, that is exactly where coaching will push you.

**What you can expect from Wes:** Pressure to keep interviewing when you want to start building. Questions about what you have learned from conversations, not what you have built. Gentle (and sometimes not-so-gentle) redirects when you try to skip ahead. If you show up and say "I built a landing page and started running ads," expect to be asked how many people you have actually talked to first.

### Late Validation -- Refining What Works

**Where you are:** You have paying customers. Revenue is coming in. But things are not yet running smoothly or scaling predictably.

**What coaching focuses on:**
- Understanding why customers stay and why they leave
- Reducing churn by having the uncomfortable conversations about what is not working
- Systematizing your processes before trying to scale them
- Understanding your unit economics -- does this business actually work financially?
- Focusing on ONE growth channel before spreading across many

**The big insight at this stage:** More activity does not mean more progress. The temptation to do everything at once is strongest here. Your job is to figure out what is actually working, double down on it, and ignore everything else -- for now.

**What you can expect from Wes:** Tough questions about your numbers. Challenges to your assumptions about why things are or are not working. Coaching focused on depth over breadth. If you are doing ten things at once, expect to be asked which one is actually driving revenue.

### Growth -- Scaling With Intention

**Where you are:** Things are working. Now the question is how to do more of it without breaking what works.

**What coaching focuses on:**
- Making smart hiring and delegation decisions
- Building repeatable, documented sales processes
- Managing a growing team and operation
- Knowing when (and whether) to raise capital
- Staying focused when every opportunity looks like a good one

**The big insight at this stage:** Growth breaks things. The processes that got you here will not get you to the next level. Your job is to build systems, hire the right people, and resist the urge to chase every shiny opportunity.

**What you can expect from Wes:** Strategic questions about focus, prioritization, and where your bottleneck actually is. Coaching that helps you think like a CEO, not just a founder who is good at the work. If you are still doing everything yourself, expect a conversation about what to delegate and to whom.

---

## Program Resources at Your Fingertips

Your coaching does not exist in a vacuum. Wes draws on a rich library of program resources and will point you to the right one at the right time. Here is what is available:

### The Lectures (Lectures 1-12)

The lecture series forms the backbone of the Launchpad Incubator curriculum. Each lecture covers a specific aspect of building a business from scratch:

- **Lectures 1-3:** Foundations -- finding problems, having customer conversations, and validating that a problem is worth solving
- **Lectures 4-6:** Validation -- testing solutions, understanding willingness to pay, and creating your first offer
- **Lectures 7-9:** Building momentum -- getting traction, systematizing early wins, and understanding your market position
- **Lectures 10-12:** Scaling -- growth strategies, team building, and building sustainable operations

When Wes references a lecture, it means the content is directly relevant to what you are working on right now. Take the time to review it -- it will make your next coaching exchange much more productive.

### The Launch System (Book -- 6 Chapters)

This is your comprehensive guide to going from idea to validated business. The six chapters walk you through the entire launch process step by step. When Wes says "Chapter 4 of the Launch System covers this," he is pointing you to a specific framework or methodology that applies to your situation.

### Ideas That Spread (Book -- 4 Chapters)

This book focuses on positioning, messaging, and making your idea resonate with the right people. If coaching surfaces a question about how to talk about your business, how to reach your audience, or how to make your offer compelling, this is likely where Wes will send you.

### How Resources Are Recommended

Wes will never dump a reading list on you. Resources are recommended **one at a time, when they are relevant**. You might hear something like:

- *"Lecture 7 walks through exactly this."*
- *"Chapter 3 of the Launch System has a good framework here."*
- *"This is a great time to revisit Lecture 4 -- the section on validation hierarchy is directly relevant."*

The goal is to give you the right resource at the right moment, not to overwhelm you with homework. When a resource is recommended, it means it directly applies to whatever you just told Wes about. Take 20 minutes to engage with it, and you will come back to your next check-in with a sharper perspective.

---

## Pausing and Resuming

Life happens. Businesses have busy seasons. Sometimes you need to step back from coaching for a while. That is completely fine -- no judgment, no questions asked.

### How to Pause

Simply reply to any coaching email with the word **"pause"** (or "take a break," "stop," or "stepping back"). You will receive a confirmation that check-ins are paused, and you will not hear from the system until you are ready.

### How to Resume

When you are ready to pick back up, reply to any previous coaching email with **"resume"** (or "I'm back," "start again," or "ready"). You will get a confirmation, and your regular check-ins will resume right where you left off.

### What Happens to Your Progress

Nothing is lost when you pause. Your entire coaching history, your journey summary, your stage, your challenges -- everything is preserved. When you come back, Wes picks up right where you left off, fully aware of your context and history. There is no catching up, no re-explaining, no starting over.

**Bottom line:** Pause when you need to. Come back when you are ready. Your coaching will be waiting for you.

---

## Staying Connected -- Gentle Re-Engagement

If you go quiet for about **10 days** without replying to a check-in, you will receive a gentle nudge from Wes. Something like: *"Haven't heard from you in a bit. Everything okay?"*

This is not a guilt trip. It is not a demand. It is just a check-in to make sure you are alright and a reminder that coaching is here when you need it.

**If you are busy:** Just send a quick reply. Even a one-liner ("Heads down on a big project, will update next week") keeps the conversation alive and lets Wes know you are fine.

**If you need a break:** Reply with "pause" and take the time you need.

**If life got in the way:** No worries. Reply when you can. There is no penalty for going quiet, and there is no catching up to do. Just jump back in with whatever you are working on right now. Wes will meet you wherever you are.

---

## Satisfaction and Feedback -- How Coaching Stays Relevant

As you exchange messages with Wes, the system naturally picks up on how engaged and satisfied you are with your coaching experience. This is not about surveillance or tracking -- it is about making sure coaching is actually landing well for you.

Here is what this means in practice:

- If your replies suggest coaching is on target and helpful, the approach stays consistent
- If something feels off -- maybe the advice is not resonating or you seem frustrated -- that signal helps Wes adjust the coaching style, focus, or approach
- Over time, this creates a feedback loop that makes your coaching experience increasingly dialed in to what works for you

**What this is NOT:** It is not a score you can fail. It is not a judgment of your progress. It is simply a way to make sure the coaching itself is working well for *you*. Think of it like a good coach reading the room -- noticing when something clicks and when something does not.

If something about the coaching is not working for you, the best thing you can do is just say so. A reply like "I am not sure this advice applies to my situation" or "I need help with something different" is incredibly valuable. Direct feedback is always welcome and always acted on.

## Tips for Getting the Most Out of Coaching

You will get out of this what you put in. Here are the habits that separate members who make real progress from those who stay stuck:

### Reply Promptly (Even If Briefly)

You do not need to write a novel. A few sentences is fine. But replying within a day or two of getting a check-in keeps the momentum going. The longer you wait, the easier it is to let things slide. Members who reply within 24 hours consistently report more progress than those who wait.

### Be Specific About Your Challenges

"Things are hard" is not something anyone can coach around. "I have had three customer calls and none of them seem interested in paying" -- now *that* is something to work with. The more specific you are, the more targeted and useful the coaching becomes.

Here is the difference:

*Vague:* "I am working on marketing."
*Specific:* "I posted on LinkedIn three times this week. Got 200 views but zero replies. Not sure if the message is wrong or the audience."

The second one gives Wes something real to coach around.

### Share Wins AND Struggles

Do not just report when things go wrong. Sharing your wins helps Wes calibrate what is working and build on it. And sharing struggles early -- before they become crises -- gives you the best chance of getting useful guidance.

Had a great customer conversation? Share it. Finally got someone to agree to pay? Celebrate it. Your wins matter and help shape the coaching.

### Take Action Between Check-Ins

Coaching is not a substitute for doing the work. When Wes suggests a next step, try to take it before your next check-in. The members who make the fastest progress are the ones who show up each cycle with something new to report -- even if it is "I tried it and it did not work." That is still forward motion.

### Engage With Recommended Resources

When Wes points you to a specific lecture or book chapter, take 20 minutes to review it. Those recommendations are not filler -- they are chosen because they directly apply to what you are working on. Coming back with thoughts or questions about the material makes the next coaching exchange much richer.

### Be Honest About What Is and Is Not Working

If the coaching advice does not feel right, say so. If you tried something and it did not work, share that. If you are avoiding something Wes suggested, be upfront about why. Honesty -- even when it is uncomfortable -- is what makes this kind of coaching effective.

The system works best when you treat Wes less like a teacher you are trying to impress and more like a trusted advisor you are being straight with.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often will I hear from Wes?

By default, you will receive check-in emails on **Tuesdays and Fridays**. You can request a different schedule with up to three check-in days per week. When you reply to a check-in, you will typically get a coaching response within a day.

### Can I change my check-in days?

Yes. Let Wes know what days work better for you, and your schedule can be adjusted. Some members prefer Monday/Wednesday/Friday, some prefer just once a week. It is flexible.

### What if I want to talk about something outside my current challenge?

Go for it. While check-ins tend to follow the thread of your recent work, you can always bring up something new in your reply. Just be specific about what you need help with, and the coaching will adapt.

### Is Coach Wes a real person?

Yes. Wes is a real person and an experienced entrepreneurship coach. The coaching system helps Wes scale his ability to work with many members at once while maintaining the quality and personalization of one-on-one coaching. Every response is informed by Wes's coaching philosophy, his program materials, and his direct involvement in the system. For sensitive situations, stage transitions, or anything that needs a particularly human touch, Wes reviews and often personally crafts the response.

### How do I pause or resume coaching?

Reply to any coaching email with **"pause"** to stop check-ins or **"resume"** to restart them. You will get a confirmation either way.

### What if I progress to a new stage?

Great question -- and congratulations. When your updates indicate you have moved to a new stage (for example, you landed your first paying customer and moved from Early Validation to Late Validation), the transition is noted and your coaching adapts accordingly. You may be asked to confirm the transition, and from that point forward, your check-ins and coaching feedback will reflect your new stage.

### Can I email Wes anytime, or only in response to check-ins?

You can reply to any coaching email at any time. The coaching thread is always open. That said, the check-in rhythm is designed to keep things focused and productive. If you have an urgent question between check-ins, reply to your most recent coaching email and it will be picked up.

### What if I do not have anything to report?

Reply anyway. "Did not make progress this week -- got pulled into a client project" is a perfectly valid update. It keeps the coaching relationship active, and Wes can often offer useful perspective even on weeks where you feel stuck or sidetracked. The worst thing you can do is go silent because you feel like you do not have enough to share.

### How is my data used?

Your coaching conversations are used to provide you with personalized coaching. Your journey history, business details, and past conversations inform future coaching so that advice stays relevant and builds on what came before. Your information is not shared with other members.

### What happens if I just stop replying?

After about 10 days of silence, you will get a gentle nudge. After about 17 days, the system marks you as inactive and stops sending check-ins. No emails are deleted, no progress is lost. Whenever you are ready to come back, just send a reply and everything picks up right where it left off.

## One Last Thing

The entrepreneurs who get the most out of this program are not the ones with the best ideas or the most experience. They are the ones who **show up consistently, do the uncomfortable work, and stay honest with their coach**.

This coaching system is designed to make that easier than it has ever been. No scheduling calls. No waiting for office hours. No hoping you can grab five minutes of attention in a crowded group. Just you, your inbox, and a coach who knows your journey and is focused on helping you take the next right step.

Reply to that first check-in. Be specific. Take action. Come back and tell Wes what happened.

That is how businesses get built.

Welcome to The Launchpad Incubator. Let's get to work.
